# Practical Programming and Numerical Methods in Julia

This repository contains a collection of scripts written in Julia, demonstrating various numerical methods and machine learning techniques. The scripts are organized into two main directories:

1. `differential_equations/`: This directory contains scripts that solve various differential equations using different methods. Here are the scripts you'll find in this directory:

    - `Belousov–Zhabotinsky.jl`: This script models the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, a classic example of a non-equilibrium chemical oscillator.
    - `FitzHugh-Nagumo.jl`:
    - `HeatEquation.jl`: This script solves the heat equation, a parabolic partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time.
    - `Hénon-Heiles.jl`:
    - `Runge-Kutta.jl`: 

2. `numerical_methods/`: This directory contains scripts that implement various numerical methods. Here are the scripts you'll find in this directory:

    - `Cholesky_decomposition.jl`: This script implements the Cholesky decomposition method, a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose.
    - `Clenshaw-Curtis.jl`: 
    - `Conjugate_gradient.jl`: This script implements the conjugate gradient method, an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations.
    - `Gradient_decent.jl`: This script implements the gradient descent optimization algorithm.
    - `bisection.jl`: This script implements the bisection method, a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function.
